# PointsPlus Tracker v4 (Expanded Measurements + Exercise Metadata)

**What’s new**
- Measurements now include: L/R calves, L/R thighs, L/R forearms, L/R biceps, buttocks, hips, waist, bust, neck, plus weight.
- Exercise log supports optional **reps** and **weight** (still credits **points** to your totals).
- Mobile: measurements table scrolls horizontally; forms are touch-friendly.
- Cache-busted file references (`?v4`) for GitHub Pages so devices load the newest files.

**Deploy**
1) Upload these four files to your repo root and publish with GitHub Pages.  
2) Hard refresh on each device (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R) or open in a Private tab the first time.

**Add to Home Screen (no extra files needed)**
- **iPhone/iPad (Safari):** open your site → Share button → **Add to Home Screen**.  
- **Android (Chrome):** open your site → ⋮ menu → **Add to Home screen**.
