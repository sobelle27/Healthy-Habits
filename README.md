# PointsPlus Tracker (GitHub Pages Ready)

- Mobile/tablet/desktop friendly
- Tabs are cache-busted (`?v3`) so new versions load on your phone
- Data stays in your browser (localStorage)

## Deploy
1. Create a repo and upload all four files.
2. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main`, folder `root`).
3. Visit the Pages URL. If you change files later, re-upload and refresh.

## If tabs don't switch on a device
- Hard refresh the page:
  - iPhone/iPad (Safari): tap the URL bar → pull down to refresh, or Settings → Safari → Clear Website Data for your site.
  - Android (Chrome): Menu → Reload or Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data (cached images/files).
  - Desktop: **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R**.
