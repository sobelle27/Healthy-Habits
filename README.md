# PointsPlus Tracker v5 (Monthly Measurements + Exercise Minutes/Reps/Weight)

**Measurements (Monthly)**
- Track by **month** with all requested fields: Weight, Neck, Bust, Waist, Hips, Buttocks, L/R Biceps, L/R Forearms, L/R Thighs, L/R Calves.
- Using the month picker keeps **one entry per month** (saving the form for the same month replaces that month's entry).
- History table scrolls horizontally on mobile.

**Exercise**
- Optional **Minutes**, **Reps**, and **Weight** fields for logging detail.
- You still enter **Points** manually; those feed the Daily/Weekly math. (No auto formula applied.)

**Deploy**
- Upload these four files to your repo root and publish with GitHub Pages.
- Cache-busted file references (`?v5`) so phones/tablets/computers fetch the latest.
- First load after updating: do a hard refresh or use a Private tab.

**Add to Home Screen**
- iPhone/iPad (Safari): Share → **Add to Home Screen**.
- Android (Chrome): ⋮ menu → **Add to Home screen**.
